## Exploratory Data Analysis

The `Exploratory_DataAnalysis.ipynb` file contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) conducted as part of my undergraduate machine learning class. This notebook includes:

- **Data Import and Cleaning**: Steps to import and clean the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation and visualization of basic statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation for various features.
- **Data Visualization**: Use of various plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to visualize the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features from existing data to enhance model performance.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examination of the correlations between features to identify potential multicollinearity issues.
- **Preliminary Insights**: Initial findings and insights based on the EDA process, which help in understanding the data better and guiding further analysis or modeling.

This notebook serves as a foundational step in the data analysis workflow, ensuring that the data is well-understood and properly prepared for subsequent machine learning tasks.
